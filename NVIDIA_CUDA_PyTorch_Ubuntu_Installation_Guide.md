# Comprehensive Guide to Installing NVIDIA CUDA and PyTorch with CUDA Support on Ubuntu Headless Systems

1. **Upgrade Your Ubuntu System**:
   Start by updating and upgrading your Ubuntu system to ensure all software is up-to-date.

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

2. **List the Recommended NVIDIA Drivers**:
   Install `ubuntu-drivers-common` and then use the `ubuntu-drivers` command to list the recommended NVIDIA drivers for your system.

   ```
   sudo apt install ubuntu-drivers-common
   sudo ubuntu-drivers devices
   ```

3. **Install the NVIDIA Driver**:
   Install the driver recommended by the `ubuntu-drivers` command. For example:

   ```
   sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535
   ```

4. **Reboot Your System**:
   After installing the driver, reboot your system to ensure proper installation.

   ```
   sudo reboot now
   ```

5. **Check the Driver Installation**:
   Once rebooted, check the installation using the NVIDIA System Management Interface.

   ```
   nvidia-smi
   ```

6. **Install GCC**:
   The GCC compiler is necessary for installing the CUDA toolkit.

   ```
   sudo apt install gcc
   gcc -v  # To verify the installation
   ```

7. **Install the CUDA Toolkit**:
   Download and install the CUDA toolkit from NVIDIAâ€™s official site.

   ```
   wget [CUDA Toolkit Link]
   sudo dpkg -i [Downloaded File]
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get -y install cuda
   ```

8. **Reboot Your System Again**:
   Reboot your system to load the required modules for CUDA.

   ```
   sudo reboot now
   ```

9. **Environment Setup**:
   Update the environment variables for CUDA.

   ```
   nano ~/.bashrc
   # Add the following lines to the file:
   export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.2/lib64\
                            ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
   # Save and exit, then reload the file
   . ~/.bashrc
   ```

10. **Test the CUDA Toolkit**:
    Test the installation by executing the CUDA compiler.

    ```
    nvcc -V
    ```

Once CUDA is installed, you can proceed to install PyTorch with CUDA support. PyTorch provides pre-built binaries with CUDA support that can be installed using `pip`. Ensure you have Python and `pip` installed, then follow these steps:

1. **Install PyTorch with CUDA**:
   Visit the [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to find the appropriate `pip` command for your system configuration (which includes CUDA version). It usually looks something like this:

   ```
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
   ```

2. **Verify PyTorch and CUDA Installation**:
   Run a Python script or enter a Python interactive shell and execute the following commands to verify the installation:

   ```python
   import torch
   print(torch.__version__)
   print(torch.cuda.is_available())
   ```

This process ensures that both NVIDIA CUDA and PyTorch with CUDA support are installed and configured correctly on your Ubuntu headless system.
